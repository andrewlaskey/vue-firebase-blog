# vue-firebase-blog

This is my current personal blog/portfolio site at [andrewlaskey.com](https://andrewlaskey.com/). It is a single-page app built with Vue.js, Vue Router, Firebase, and using [Vueify](https://github.com/vuejs/vueify) as the project base. The Add Post view also uses the [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) CSS framework.

## To Do

- [ ] Add ability for logged in user to edit posts
- [ ] Add routes for posts to router
- [ ] Add category filter
- [ ] Tests
